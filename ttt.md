Overall Layout
The interface uses a two-pane layout, with a sidebar on the left and a main content area on the right.
The sidebar extends the full height of the page.
The main content area has a header section at the top with additional content below it.

# Sidebar

The sidebar has a dark background, possibly a dark gray or black, creating a contrast with the white main content area.
It contains a list of menu items, each represented by an icon and a label.
The labels appear to be aligned to the left, next to the icons.
The menu item for TextTract appears to be selected or highlighted, suggesting a state change to indicate the current
page or function.

# Main Content Area

The main content area has a white or light-colored background.
At the top, the name "TextTract" serves as the title in a larger bold font.
Right below the title is a description of the service in a smaller font size, providing a succinct explanation of the
tool's purpose.
Below the service description, there's the attribution to the creator with a slightly smaller font size than the
description.
The remainder of the content area mimics a chat interface with various user prompts presented in a conversational
format.
These prompts are likely interactive elements, such as buttons or links, that the user can click on to perform certain
actions.
At the bottom of the content area, there's an input field with placeholder text that invites the user to send a message
to the service.

# Typography

The interface uses sans-serif fonts throughout.
The title "TextTract" is the largest text on the page, making it stand out as the main heading.
The service description and creator attribution have progressively smaller font sizes.

# Color and Style

The interface's color scheme is monochromatic, relying on shades of gray and black for the sidebar and white for the
main content area, which provides a professional and modern appearance.
The user prompts within the main content area are likely styled to look like clickable elements, possibly with a
different color or underline to signify interactivity.
Interaction Elements
The sidebar menu items change appearance on selection, providing visual feedback to the user.
The chat-like prompts in the main content area suggest a user interaction model where commands or requests can be given
in a conversational manner.
The message input box at the bottom indicates a real-time, interactive service, possibly powered by a chatbot or similar
automated service.
